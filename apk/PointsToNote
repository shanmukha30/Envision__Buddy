Following are some points to note regarding the application:

1. The app will run on all devices running Android Nougat and above (Android 7.0+).
2. Make sure the Google Search App is updated to the latest version on your device.
3. If your device supports ARCore, only then will you be able to use the "View in your space feature". Update AR Core to the latest version to get the best experience.
4. "View in 3D" features works on all models.
5. Kindly grant the permissions for storage and camera.
6. The ML model for text classification is hosted on a localhost server which remains active for only 2 hours before it changes its URL, so there is a possibility that 
when this app might be tested, the link present in the code may have expired and thus the app may not give the expected output. In that case if possible please feel free to
contact us and we would willingly generate and update the project with a new code.
